description: |
  A Helm chart for deploying a Tyk data plane for Tyk Self Managed MDCB or Tyk Cloud users.
  It will deploy the data plane components that remotely connect to a MDCB control plane.
  It includes the Tyk Gateway, an open source Enterprise API Gateway, supporting REST, GraphQL, TCP and gRPC protocols;
  and Tyk Pump, an analytics purger that moves the data generated by your Tyk gateways to any back-end.
  Furthermore, it has all the required modifications to easily connect to Tyk Cloud or Multi Data Center (MDCB) control plane.

  This chart has been deprecated. Please use tyk-data-plane chart instead.

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
version: 1.0.0
