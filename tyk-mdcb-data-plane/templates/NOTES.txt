Thank you for installing Tyk Data Plane Chart {{ .Chart.Name }}. Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}. At this point, Tyk Data Plane is fully installed and should be accessible.

To quickly test everything is ok, you can port-forward gateway pod to 9696 on your machine:
    kubectl port-forward service/gateway-control-svc-{{ .Release.Name }}-{{ $gwDependency }} {{ index .Values "tyk-gateway" "gateway" "control" "containerPort" }}:{{ index .Values "tyk-gateway" "gateway" "control" "port" }}
and run `curl localhost:{{ index .Values "tyk-gateway" "gateway" "control" "containerPort" }}/hello` to see some data back that includes redis and rpc info.
{{- else }}

To quickly test everything is ok, you can port-forward gateway pod to {{ index .Values "global" "servicePorts" "gateway" }} on your machine:
    kubectl port-forward service/gateway-svc-{{ .Release.Name }}-{{ $gwDependency }} {{ index .Values "global" "servicePorts" "gateway" }}:{{ index .Values "tyk-gateway" "gateway" "service" "port" }}
and run `curl localhost:{{ index .Values "global" "servicePorts" "gateway" }}/hello` to see some data back that includes redis and rpc info.
