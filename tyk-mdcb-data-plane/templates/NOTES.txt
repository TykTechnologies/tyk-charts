{{- $gwDependency = $dep.Name -}}

To quickly test everything is ok, you can port-forward gateway pod to 9696 on your machine:
    kubectl port-forward service/gateway-control-svc-{{ include "tyk-gateway.fullname" . }}-{{ $gwDependency }} 9696:{{ index .Values "tyk-gateway" "gateway" "control" "port" }}

and run `curl localhost:9696/hello` to see some data back that includes redis and rpc info.

To quickly test everything is ok, you can port-forward gateway pod to 8080 on your machine:
