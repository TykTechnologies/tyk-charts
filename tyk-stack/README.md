## Tyk Stack

`tyk-stack` provides the default deployment of Tyk Self Managed on a cluster. 
It will deploy all required Tyk components with the settings provided in the `values-stack.yaml` file.

It includes:
- Tyk Gateway, an open source Enterprise API Gateway (supporting REST, GraphQL, TCP and gRPC protocols).
- Tyk Pump, an analytics purger that moves the data generated by your Tyk nodes to any back-end. Furthermore, it has all the required modifications to easily connect to Tyk Cloud or Multi Data Center (MDCB) control plane.
- Tyk Dashboard, a license based component that provides GUI management interface and analytics platform for Tyk.
- Tyk Developer Enterprise Portal, a full-fledged CMS-like system for API providers to publish, monetise and drive the adoption of APIs.

## Introduction

By default, this chart installs following components as subcharts on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh/) package manager.

| Component                       | Enabled by Default | Flag                        |
|---------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Tyk Gateway                     | true               | n/a                         |
| Tyk Pump                        | true               | global.components.pump      |
| Tyk Dashboard                   | true               | global.components.dashboard |
| Tyk Developer Enterprise Portal | false              | global.components.devPortal | 

To enable or disable each component, change the corresponding enabled flag.

Also, you can set the version of each component through `image.tag`. You could find the list of version tags available from [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/tykio).

## Prerequisites

* Kubernetes 1.19+
* Helm 3+
* Redis should already be installed or accessible by the gateway. For Redis installation instruction, please see https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-oss/ce-helm-chart/#recommended-via-bitnami-chart.

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart from Git repository in namespace `tyk` with the release name `tyk-stack`:
```bash
helm repo add tyk-helm https://helm.tyk.io/public/helm/charts/
helm repo update
helm show values tyk-helm/tyk-stack > values-stack.yaml --devel
```

At a minimum, modify `values-stack.yaml `for the following settings:
1. [Set Redis connection details](#set-redis-connection-details-required)
2. [Set Mongo or PostgresSQL connection details](#set-mongo-or-postgressql-connection-details-required)
3. [Dashboard License](#dashboard-license)

If you would like to use Enterprise Developer Portal, additional license is required:

4. [Enterprise Developer Portal License](#tyk-developer-enterprise-portal-license-required)

Then just run:
```bash
helm install tyk-stack tyk-helm/tyk-stack -n tyk --create-namespace -f values-stack.yaml --devel
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

```bash
helm uninstall tyk-stack -n tyk
```
This removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Upgrading Chart

```bash
helm upgrade tyk-stack tyk-helm/tyk-stack -n tyk --devel
```

_Note: Upgrading from tyk-pro chart_

If you were using `tyk-pro` chart for existing release, you cannot upgrade directly. Please modify the `values-stack.yaml` base on your requirements and install using the new `tyk-stack` chart.

## Configuration

To get all configurable options with detailed comments:

```bash
helm show values tyk-helm/tyk-stack > values-stack.yaml --devel
```

You can update any value in your local `values-stack.yaml` file and use `-f [filename]` flag to override default values during installation. 
Alternatively, you can use `--set` flag to set it in Tyk installation. See [Using Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/) for examples.

### Set Redis connection details (Required)

Tyk uses Redis for distributed rate-limiting and token storage. You may set `global.redis.addr` and `global.redis.pass` with redis connection
string and password respectively.

If you do not already have redis installed, you may use these charts provided by Bitnami

```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm install tyk-redis bitnami/redis -n tyk --create-namespace --set image.tag=6.2.13
```

Follow the notes from the installation output to get connection details and password. The DNS name of your Redis as set by Bitnami is
`tyk-redis-master.tyk.svc:6379` (Tyk needs the name including the port)

### Set MongoDB or PostgresSQL connection details (Required)
If you have already installed MongoDB or PostgreSQL, you can set the connection details in `global.mongo` and `global.postgres` section of values file respectively.

If not, you can use these rather excellent charts provided by Bitnami to install MongoDB or PostgreSQL:

**Mongo Installation**

```bash
helm install tyk-mongo bitnami/mongodb --version {HELM_CHART_VERSION} --set "replicaSet.enabled=true" -n tyk
```

**PostgresSQL Installation**
```bash
helm install tyk-postgres bitnami/postgresql --set "auth.database=tyk_analytics" -n tyk
```

Follow the notes from the installation output to get connection details.

>NOTE: Please make sure you are installing MongoDB or PostgreSQL versions that are supported by Tyk. Please refer to Tyk docs to get list of supported versions.

### Protect Confidential Fields with Kubernetes Secrets

In the `values-stack.yaml` file, some fields are considered confidential, such as `APISecret`, connection strings, etc.
Declaring values for such fields as plain text might not be desired for all use cases. Instead, for certain fields,
Kubernetes secrets can be referenced, and Kubernetes by itself configures values based on the referred secret.

This section describes how to use Kubernetes secrets to declare confidential fields.

#### Tyk Dashboard Admin

If Tyk Dashboard bootstrapping is enabled, Tyk Dashboard admin user will be created according to the `global.adminUser` field.

All admin credentials can also be set through Kubernetes secret.

> [!NOTE]
> Once `global.adminUser.useSecretName` is declared, it takes precedence over `global.adminUser.firstName`, 
> `global.adminUser.lastName`, `global.adminUser.email` and `global.adminUser.password`.

> [!WARNING]
> If `global.adminUser.useSecretName` is in use, please add all keys mentioned below to the secret.

##### Admin First Name

It can be configured via `global.adminUser.firstName` as a plain text or Kubernetes secret which includes `adminUserFirstName` key
in it. Then, this secret must be referenced via `global.adminUser.useSecretName`.


##### Admin Last Name

It can be configured via `global.adminUser.lastName` as a plain text or Kubernetes secret which includes `adminUserLastName` key
in it. Then, this secret must be referenced via `global.adminUser.useSecretName`.

##### Admin Email

It can be configured via `global.adminUser.email` as a plain text or Kubernetes secret which includes `adminUserEmail` key
in it. Then, this secret must be referenced via `global.adminUser.useSecretName`.


##### Admin Password

It can be configured via `global.adminUser.password` as a plain text or Kubernetes secret which includes `adminUserPassword` key
in it. Then, this secret must be referenced via `global.adminUser.useSecretName`.

#### APISecret

The [`APISecret`](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-oss-gateway/configuration/#secret) field configures a header value used in every
interaction with Tyk Gateway API.
interaction with Tyk Gateway API.

It can be configured via `global.secrets.APISecret` as a plain text or Kubernetes secret which includes `APISecret` key
in it. Then, this secret must be referenced via `global.secrets.useSecretName`.

```yaml
global:
    secrets:
        APISecret: CHANGEME
        useSecretName: "mysecret" # where mysecret includes `APISecret` key with the desired value.
```

#### AdminSecret

[`AdminSecret](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-dashboard/configuration/#admin_secret) sets a secret for Admin API.

It can be configured via `global.secrets.AdminSecret` as a plain text or Kubernetes secret which includes `AdminSecret` 
key in it. Then, this secret must be referenced via `global.secrets.useSecretName`.

```yaml
global:
    secrets:
        useSecretName: "mysecret" # where mysecret includes `useSecretName` key with the desired value.
```

> [!NOTE]
> Once `global.secrets.useSecretName` is declared, it takes precedence over `global.secrets.APISecret` and `global.secrets.AdminSecret`.

#### Dashboard License

In order to refer Tyk Dashboard license through Kubernetes secret, please use `global.secrets.useSecretName`, where 
the secret should contain a key called `DashLicense`.

#### Tyk Developer Enterprise Portal License

In order to refer Tyk Developer Enterprise Portal license through Kubernetes secret, please use `global.secrets.useSecretName`, 
where the secret should contain a key called `EnterprisePortalLicense`.

#### Tyk Developer Enterprise Portal Admin Password

In order to refer Tyk Developer Enterprise Portal's admin password through Kubernetes secret, 
please use `global.adminUser.useSecretName`, where the secret should contain a key called `adminUserPassword`.

#### Tyk Developer Enterprise Portal Storage Connection String

In order to refer Tyk Enterprise Portal connection string to the selected database through Kubernetes secret,
please use `global.secrets.useSecretName`, where the secret should contain a key called 
`EnterprisePortalStorageConnectionString`.

> [!WARNING]
> If `global.secrets.useSecretName` is in use, please add all keys mentioned above to the secret. 

#### Remote Control Plane Configuration

All configurations regarding remote control plane (`orgId`, `userApiKey`, and `groupID`) can be set via
Kubernetes secret.

Instead of explicitly setting them in the values file, just create a Kubernetes secret including `orgId`, `userApiKey`
and `groupID` keys and refer to it in `global.remoteControlPlane.useSecretName`.

```yaml
global:
  remoteControlPlane:
    useSecretName: "foo-secret"
```

where `foo-secret` should contain `orgId`, `userApiKey` and `groupID` keys in it.

#### Redis Password

Redis password can also be provided via a secret. Store Redis password in Kubernetes secret and refer to this secret
via `global.redis.passSecret.name` and `global.redis.passSecret.keyName` field, as follows:

```yaml
global:  
  redis:
     passSecret:
       name: "yourSecret"
       keyName: "redisPassKey"
```

#### MongoDB or Postgres connection strings

Storage connection strings can also be provided via a secret. Store the connection string in Kubernetes secret and 
refer to this secret via `global.{mongo,postgres}.connectionURLSecret.name` and `global.{mongo,postgres}.connectionURLSecret.keyName` field, 
as follows:

- MongoDB:
```yaml
global:  
  mongo:
    connectionURLSecret:
       name: "yourSecret"
       keyName: "redisPassKey"
```

- PostgreSQL:
```yaml
global:
  postgres:
    connectionURLSecret:
       name: "yourSecret"
       keyName: "redisPassKey"
```

### Gateway Configurations

Configure below inside `tyk-gateway` section.

<!-- BEGIN import from gateway doc -->

#### Enabling TLS
We have provided an easy way of enabling TLS via the `global.tls.gateway` flag. Setting this value to true will
automatically enable TLS using the certificate provided under tyk-gateway/certs/cert.pem.

If you want to use your own key/cert pair, you must follow the following steps:
1. Create a tls secret using your cert and key pair.
2. Set `global.tls.gateway`  to true.
3. Set `global.tls.useDefaultTykCertificate` to false.
4. Set `gateway.tls.secretName` to the name of the newly created secret.

#### Enable gateway autoscaling

This chart allows for easy configuration of autoscaling parameters. To simply enable autoscaling it's enough to add `--set tyk-gateway.gateway.autoscaling.enabled=true`. That will enable `Horizontal Pod Autoscaler` resource with default parameters (avg. CPU load at 60%, scaling between 1 and 3 instances). To customize those values you can add `--set tyk-gateway.gateway.autoscaling.averageCpuUtilization=75` or use `values-stack.yaml` file:

```yaml
tyk-gateway:
  gateway:
    autoscaling:
      enabled: true
      minReplicas: 3
      maxReplicas: 30
```

Built-in rules include `tyk-gateway.gateway.autoscaling.averageCpuUtilization` for CPU utilization (set by default at 60%) and `tyk-gateway.gateway.autoscaling.averageMemoryUtilization` for memory (disabled by default). In addition to that you can define rules for custom metrics using `tyk-gateway.gateway.autoscaling.autoscalingTemplate` list:

```yaml
tyk-gateway:
  gateway:
    autoscaling:
      autoscalingTemplate:
        - type: Pods
          pods:
            metric:
              name: nginx_ingress_controller_nginx_process_requests_total
            target:
              type: AverageValue
              averageValue: 10000m
```

#### OpenTelemetry
To enable OpenTelemetry for Gateway set `gateway.opentelemetry.enabled` flag to true. It is disabled by default.

You can also configure connection settings for it's exporter. By default `grpc` exporter is enabled on `localhost:4317` endpoint.

 To enable TLS settings for the exporter, you can set `gateway.opentelemetry.tls.enabled` to true. 

### Pump Configurations

To enable Pump, set `global.components.pump` to true, and configure below inside `tyk-pump` section.

<!-- BEGIN import from pump doc -->

| Pump                      | Configuration                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Prometheus Pump (Default) | Add the value `prometheus` to the `tyk-pump.pump.backend` entry, and add connection details for Prometheus under `tyk-pump.pump.prometheusPump`. |
| Mongo Pump                | Add `mongo` to `tyk-pump.pump.backend`, and add connection details for mongo under `global.mongo`.                                               |
| Mongo Selective Pump      | Add `mongo-selective` to `tyk-pump.pump.backend`, and add connection details for mongo under `global.mongo`.                                     |
| Mongo Aggregate Pump      | Add `mongo-aggregate` to `tyk-pump.pump.backend`, and add connection details for mongo under `global.mongo`.                                     |
| Postgres Pump             | Add `postgres` to `tyk-pump.pump.backend`, and add connection details for postgres under `global.postgres`.                                      |
| Postgres Aggregate Pump   | Add `postgres-aggregate` to `tyk-pump.pump.backend`, and add connection details for postgres under `global.postgres`.                            |
| Uptime Pump               | Set `tyk-pump.pump.uptimePumpBackend` to `mongo` or `postgres` or `""`                                                                           |
| Other Pumps               | Add the required environment variables in `tyk-pump.pump.extraEnvs`                                                                              |

> [!NOTE]
> For additional information on Tyk Pump configurations, refer to the 
[Setup Dashboard Analytics](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-pump/tyk-pump-configuration/tyk-pump-dashboard-config/) documentation.

> To explore the list of supported backends for Tyk Pump, please visit https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-stack/tyk-pump/other-data-stores/.

#### Prometheus Pump
Add `prometheus` to `tyk-pump.pump.backend`, and add connection details for Prometheus under `tyk-pump.pump.prometheusPump`. 

We also support monitoring using Prometheus Operator. All you have to do is set `tyk-pump.pump.prometheusPump.prometheusOperator.enabled` to true.
This will create a _PodMonitor_ resource for your Pump instance.

```yaml
    # prometheusPump configures Tyk Pump to expose Prometheus metrics.
    # Please add "prometheus" to .Values.pump.backend in order to enable Prometheus Pump.
    prometheusPump:
      # host represents the host without port, where Tyk Pump serve the metrics for Prometheus.
      host: ""
      # port represents the port where Tyk Pump serve the metrics for Prometheus.
      port: 9090
      # path represents the path to the Prometheus collection. For example /metrics.
      path: /metrics
      # customMetrics allows defining custom Prometheus metrics for Tyk Pump.
      # It accepts a string that represents a JSON object. For instance,
      #
      # customMetrics: '[{"name":"tyk_http_requests_total","description":"Total of API requests","metric_type":"counter","labels":["response_code","api_name","method","api_key","alias","path"]},          {              "name":"tyk_http_latency",              "description":"Latency of API requests",              "metric_type":"histogram",              "labels":["type","response_code","api_name","method","api_key","alias","path"]          }]'
      customMetrics: ""
      # If you are using prometheus Operator, set the fields in the section below.
      prometheusOperator:
        # enabled determines whether the Prometheus Operator is in use or not. By default,
        # it is disabled.
        # Tyk Pump can be monitored with PodMonitor Custom Resource of Prometheus Operator.
        # If enabled, PodMonitor resource is created based on .Values.pump.prometheusPump.prometheusOperator.podMonitorSelector
        # for Tyk Pump.
        enabled: false
        # podMonitorSelector represents a podMonitorSelector of your Prometheus resource. So that
        # your Prometheus resource can select PodMonitor objects based on selector defined here.
        # Please set this field to the podMonitorSelector field of your monitoring.coreos.com/v1
        # Prometheus resource's spec.
        #
        # You can check the podMonitorSelector via:
        #   kubectl describe prometheuses.monitoring.coreos.com <PROMETHEUS_POD>
        podMonitorSelector:
          release: prometheus-stack
```

#### Mongo pump
If you are using the MongoDB pumps in the tyk-oss installation you will require MongoDB installed for that as well.

To install MongoDB you can use these rather excellent charts provided by Bitnami:

```bash
helm install tyk-mongo bitnami/mongodb --version {HELM_CHART_VERSION} --set "replicaSet.enabled=true" -n tyk
```

(follow notes from the installation output to get connection details and update them in `values-stack.yaml` file)

> [!NOTE]
[Here is](https://tyk.io/docs/planning-for-production/database-settings/) list of supported MongoDB versions.
Please make sure you are installing mongo helm chart that matches these version.

> [!NOTE]
> Important Note regarding MongoDB:
> This helm chart enables the PodDisruptionBudget for MongoDB with an arbiter replica-count of 1.
> If you intend to perform system maintenance on the node where the MongoDB pod is running and this maintenance requires
> for the node to be drained, this action will be prevented due the replica count being 1.
> Increase the replica count in the helm chart deployment to a minimum of 2 to remedy this issue.

```yaml
 # Set mongo connection details if you want to configure mongo pump.
 mongo:
    # The mongoURL value will allow you to set your MongoDB address.
    # Default value: mongodb://mongo.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc:27017/tyk_analytics
    # mongoURL: mongodb://mongo.tyk.svc:27017/tyk_analytics
    # If your MongoDB has a password you can add the username and password to the url
    # mongoURL: mongodb://root:pass@tyk-mongo-mongodb.tyk.svc:27017/tyk_analytics?authSource=admin
    mongoURL: <MongoDB address>

   # mongo-go driver is supported for Tyk 5.0.2+.
   # We recommend using the mongo-go driver if you are using MongoDB 4.4.x+.
   # For MongoDB versions prior to 4.4, please use the mgo driver.
    driver: mgo
    
    # Enables SSL for MongoDB connection. MongoDB instance will have to support that.
    # Default value: false
    # useSSL: false
```

#### SQL pump
If you are using the SQL pumps in the tyk-oss installation you will require PostgreSQL installed for that as well.

To install PostgreSQL you can use these rather excellent charts provided by Bitnami:

```bash
helm install tyk-postgres bitnami/postgresql --set "auth.database=tyk_analytics" -n tyk
```

(follow notes from the installation output to get connection details and update them in `values-stack.yaml` file)

```yaml
  # Postgres connection string parameters.
  postgres:
    # host corresponds to the host name of postgres
    host: tyk-postgres-postgresql.tyk.svc
    # port corresponds to the port of postgres
    port: 5432
    # user corresponds to the user of postgres
    user: postgres
    # password corresponds to the password of the given postgres user in selected database
    password:
    # database corresponds to the database to be used in postgres
    database: tyk_analytics
    # sslmode corresponds to if postgres runs in sslmode (https)
    sslmode: disable
    # Connection string can also be set using a secret. Provide the name of the secret and key below.
    # connectionStringSecret:
    #   name: ""
    #   keyName: ""
```

#### Uptime Pump
Uptime Pump can be configured by setting `pump.uptimePumpBackend` in values-stack.yaml file. It supports following values
1. mongo: Used to set mongo pump for uptime analytics. Mongo Pump should be enabled.
2. postgres: Used to set postgres pump for uptime analytics. Postgres Pump should be enabled.
3. empty: Used to disable uptime analytics.

#### Other Pumps
To set up other backends for pump, refer to this [document](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-pump/blob/master/README.md#pumps--back-ends-supported) and add the required environment variables in `pump.extraEnvs`

#### Tyk Dashboard
The Tyk Dashboard can be configured by modifying the values under `tyk-dashboard` section of the `values-stack.yaml` file
The chart is provided with sane defaults such that the only hard requirement is the license which needs to be put under
`.Values.global.license.dashboard` in order for the bootstrapping process to work.

```yaml
  tyk-dashboard:
    dashboard:
        # This is the URL of your Tyk Gateway node, which is used to set TYK_DB_TYKAPI_HOST.
        # The Dashboard controls Tyk using the Gateway API and only requires visibility to one node. In a sharded environment,
        # the Gateway node specified here must not be sharded.
        # - If you are using tyk-stack chart, it is automatically set to the gateway service URL.
        #   HOWEVER, if Tyk Gateway runs with custom service name, please override with the correct URL using this field.
        # - If you are using tyk-dashboard chart, you need to set the correct Gateway URL here too.
        # The URL needs to be formatted as: http://gateway_host
        tykApiHost: ""
        # enableOwnership specifies if API Ownership for Self-Managed installations is enabled or not.
        # It is used to set TYK_DB_ENABLEOWNERSHIP

        notifyOnChange: true
        # hashKeys specifies that if your Tyk Gateway is using hashed keys, set this value to true so it matches.
        # The Dashboard will now operate in a mode that is compatible with key hashing.
        # It is used to set TYK_DB_HASHKEYS
        hashKeys: true
        # enableDuplicateSlugs configures the dashboard whether validate against other listen paths.
        # Setting this option to true will cause the dashboard to NOT validate against other listen paths.

        showOrgId: true
        hostConfig:
          # Enable this option to have the Dashboard only allow access on a specific domain and 404 on any other host access
          # It is used to set TYK_DB_HOSTCONFIG_ENABLEHOSTNAMES
          enableHostNames: true
          # By default, for developer portal, Tyk will add orgID prefix. Set to true if you have single tenant application or each portal on separate domain.
          # It is used to set TYK_DB_HOSTCONFIG_DISABLEORGSLUGPREFIX
          disableOrgSlugPrefix: true
          # Set this value to whatever hostname your Tyk Gateway is running on.
          # It is used to set TYK_DB_HOSTCONFIG_GATEWAYHOSTNAME
          overrideHostname: *gwHostName
        # The path to the home directory of Tyk Dashboard, this must be set in order for Portal templates and other files to be loadable.
        # It is used to set TYK_DB_HOMEDIR
        homeDir: "/opt/tyk-dashboard"
        # If using the mongo-pump-selective pump, where data is written to org-id-specific collections in MongoDB,
        # then enabling this option will switch querying for analytics over to the independent collection entries.
        # It is used to set TYK_DB_USESHARDEDANALYTICS
        useShardedAnalytics: false
        # If using the new Aggregate Pump, Tyk Analytics can make use of the newer, faster Analytics lookup,
        # to ensure that this can be made backwards compatible.This option must be set to true,
        # in conjunction with the aggregate_lookup_cutoff value.
        # It is used to set TYK_DB_ENABLEAGGREGATELOOKUPS
        enableAggregateLookups: true
        # TYK_DB_ENABLEANALYTICSCACHE
        enableAnalyticsCache: true
        # Set this value to true if you are planning to use Tyk Sync or Tyk Operator

### Tyk Developer Enterprise Portal Configurations

To enable Tyk Developer Enterprise Portal, set `global.components.devPortal` to true, and configure below inside `tyk-dev-portal` section.

#### Tyk Developer Enterprise Portal License (Required)

Tyk Developer Enterprise Portal License is required. It can be set up in `tyk-dev-portal.license` or through secret `global.secrets.useSecretName`. The secret should contain a key called `DevPortalLicense`.

```yaml
tyk-dev-portal:
  # Tyk Developer Portal license.
  license: ""
```

#### Storage Settings

Tyk Enterprise Portal supports different storage options for storing the portal's CMS assets such as images, theme files and Open API Specification files. 
Please see the [Enterprise Portal Storage settings](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/install-tyk-enterprise-portal/configuration#portal-settings) page for all the available options. 
Helm chart supports the setting of the following fields in `values-stack.yaml` `storage` and `database` section:

```yaml
tyk-dev-portal:
  storage:
    # User can set the storage type for portal.
    # Supported types: fs, s3, db
    type: "db"
    # Configuration values for using s3 as storage for Tyk Developer Portal
    # In case you want to provide the key ID and access key via secrets please
    # refer to the existing secret inside the helm chart or the
    # .Values.useSecretName field
    s3:
      awsAccessKeyid: your-access-key
      awsSecretAccessKey: your-secret-key
      region: sa-east-1
      endpoint: https://s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com
      bucket: your-portal-bucket
      acl: private
      presign_urls: true
    persistence:
      mountExistingPVC: ""
      storageClass: ""
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      size: 8Gi
      annotations: {}
      labels: {}
      selector: {}
  database:
    # This selects the SQL dialect to be used
    # The supported values are mysql, postgres and sqlite3
    dialect: "sqlite3"
    connectionString: "db/portal.db"
    enableLogs: false
    maxRetries: 3
    retryDelay: 5000
```

#### Other Configurations

Other [Enterprise Portal configurations](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-stack/tyk-developer-portal/enterprise-developer-portal/install-tyk-enterprise-portal/configuration) can be set by using environment variables with `extraEnvs` fields, e.g.:

```yaml
tyk-dev-portal:
  extraEnvs:
  - name: PORTAL_LOG_LEVEL
    value: debug
```
