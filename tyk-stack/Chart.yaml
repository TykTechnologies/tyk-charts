  Chart provides the default deployment of Tyk Self Managed on a cluster.
  It will deploy all required Tyk components with the settings provided in the values.yaml file.
  It includes: 
  Tyk Gateway, an open source Enterprise API Gateway (supporting REST, GraphQL, TCP and gRPC protocols).
  Tyk Pump, an analytics purger that moves the data generated by your Tyk nodes to any back-end. Furthermore, it has all the required modifications to easily connect to Tyk Cloud or Multi Data Center (MDCB) control plane.
  Tyk Dashboard, a license based component that provides GUI management interface and analytics platform for Tyk.
  Tyk Developer Enterprise Portal, a full-fledged CMS-like system for API providers to publish, monetise and drive the adoption of APIs.

# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
#
# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
# to be deployed.
#
# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
type: application

# This is the chart version. This version number should be incremented each time you make changes
# to the chart and its templates, including the app version.
# Versions are expected to follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/)
