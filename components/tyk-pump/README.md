## Tyk Pump
Tyk Pump is a pluggable analytics purger to move Analytics generated by your Tyk nodes to any back-end.

[Overview of Tyk Pump](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-pump/)

[More on pump configurations](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-pump/blob/master/README.md#pumps--back-ends-supported)

## Introduction
This chart deploys the open source Tyk pump on a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh/) package manager.

For typical usage, we recommend using following umbrella charts:
* For Tyk Open Source, please use [tyk-oss](../../tyk-oss)
* For Tyk Hybrid Gateway with Tyk Cloud or MDCB Remote Gateway, please use [tyk-data-plane](../../tyk-data-plane)
* For Tyk Self-Managed, please use [tyk-stack](../../tyk-stack)

[Learn more about different deployment options](https://tyk.io/docs/apim/)

## Prerequisites
* Kubernetes 1.19+
* Helm 3+
* [Redis](https://tyk.io/docs/planning-for-production/redis/)

## Installing the Chart
To install the chart from the Helm repository in namespace `tyk` with the release name `tyk-pump`:

```bash
helm repo add tyk-helm https://helm.tyk.io/public/helm/charts/
helm repo update
helm show values tyk-helm/tyk-pump > values-pump.yaml
```

Note: Set Redis connection details first. See [Configuration](#configuration) below.

```bash
helm install tyk-pump tyk-helm/tyk-pump -n tyk --create-namespace -f values-pump.yaml
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

```bash
helm uninstall tyk-pump -n tyk
```
This removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Upgrading Chart

```bash
helm upgrade tyk-pump tyk-helm/tyk-pump -n tyk
```

### Upgrading from tyk-headless chart
Please see Migration notes in [tyk-oss](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-charts/tree/main/tyk-oss) chart

## Configuration
See [Customizing the Chart Before Installing](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing).

To get all configurable options with detailed comments:

```bash
helm show values tyk-helm/tyk-pump > values.yaml
```

You can update any value in your local values.yaml file and use `-f [filename]` flag to override default values during installation. 
Alternatively, you can use `--set` flag to set it in Tyk installation.

### Set Redis connection details (Required)
Redis is Tyk Pump's primary database where it scrapes Tyk Gateway analytics from. 
You may set `global.redis.addr` and `global.redis.pass` with redis connection string and password for Tyk Gateway respectively.

### Pump Configurations

> [!NOTE] 
> For additional information on Tyk Pump configurations, 
refer to the [Setup Dashboard Analytics](https://tyk.io/docs/tyk-pump/tyk-pump-configuration/tyk-pump-dashboard-config/) documentation.

#### Prometheus Pump
Add `prometheus` to `pump.backend`, and add connection details for prometheus under `pump.prometheusPump`. 

We also support monitoring using Prometheus Operator. All you have to do is set `pump.prometheusPump.prometheusOperator.enabled` to true.
This will create a PodMonitor resource for your Pump instance.

#### Mongo Pump
If you are using the MongoDB pumps in the `tyk-oss` installation you will require MongoDB installed for that as well.

To install MongoDB you can use these rather excellent charts provided by Bitnami:

```bash
helm install tyk-mongo bitnami/mongodb --version {HELM_CHART_VERSION} --set "replicaSet.enabled=true" -n tyk
```

(follow notes from the installation output to get connection details and update them in `values.yaml` file)

> [!NOTE]
[Here is](https://tyk.io/docs/planning-for-production/database-settings/) list of supported MongoDB versions. 
Please make sure you are installing mongo helm chart that matches these version.

> [!NOTE]
> Important Note regarding MongoDB: 
> This helm chart enables the PodDisruptionBudget for MongoDB with an arbiter replica-count of 1. 
> If you intend to perform system maintenance on the node where the MongoDB pod is running and this maintenance requires 
> for the node to be drained, this action will be prevented due the replica count being 1. 
> Increase the replica count in the helm chart deployment to a minimum of 2 to remedy this issue.

Add following under the `global` section in `values.yaml`:

```yaml
   # Set mongo connection details if you want to configure mongo pump.     
   mongo:
      # The mongoURL value will allow you to set your MongoDB address.
      # Default value: mongodb://mongo.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc:27017/tyk_analytics
      # mongoURL: mongodb://mongo.tyk.svc:27017/tyk_analytics
      # If your MongoDB has a password you can add the username and password to the url
      # mongoURL: mongodb://root:pass@tyk-mongo-mongodb.tyk.svc:27017/tyk_analytics?authSource=admin
      mongoURL: <MongoDB address>
      
     # mongo-go driver is supported for Tyk 5.0.2+.
     # We recommend using the mongo-go driver if you are using MongoDB 4.4.x+.
     # For MongoDB versions prior to 4.4, please use the mgo driver.
     # Since Pump 1.9 the default driver is mongo-go.
      driver: mongo-go

      # Enables SSL for MongoDB connection. MongoDB instance will have to support that.
      # Default value: false
      # useSSL: false
```

#### SQL Pump
If you are using the SQL pumps in the tyk-oss installation you will require PostgreSQL installed for that as well.

To install PostgreSQL you can use these rather excellent charts provided by Bitnami:

```bash
helm install tyk-postgres bitnami/postgresql --set "auth.database=tyk_analytics" -n tyk
```

(follow notes from the installation output to get connection details and update them in `values.yaml` file)

Add following under the `global` section in `values.yaml`:

```yaml
  # Postgres connection string parameters.
  postgres:
    # host corresponds to the host name of postgres
    host: tyk-postgres-postgresql.tyk.svc
    # port corresponds to the port of postgres
    port: 5432
    # user corresponds to the user of postgres
    user: postgres
    # password corresponds to the password of the given postgres user in selected database
    password:
    # database corresponds to the database to be used in postgres
    database: tyk_analytics
    # sslmode corresponds to if postgres runs in sslmode (https)
    sslmode: disable
    # Connection string can also be set using a secret. Provide the name of the secret and key below.
    # connectionStringSecret:
    #   name: ""
    #   keyName: ""
```

#### Hybrid Pump
Hybrid Pump can be configured by setting `pump.backend` to `hybrid`. 
Set the connection details of your control plane in `global.remoteControlPlane` field of values file. 
Connection details can be stored either directly in the values file or you can store it in k8s secret and provide reference
to it in the `global.remoteControlPlane.useSecretName` field.

```yaml
  # Set remoteControlPlane connection details if you want to configure hybrid pump.
  remoteControlPlane:
      # useSecretName can be used if you don't want to store plaintext values for remote control plane configurations in
      # the Helm value file and would rather provide the k8s Secret externally.
      # You should set following fields in the secret
      # - orgId - Sets slave_options.rpc_key of Tyk Gateway
      # - userApiKey - Sets slave_options.api_key of Tyk Gateway
      # - groupID - Sets slave_options.group_id of Tyk Gateway
      useSecretName: ""
      # connection string used to connect to an MDCB deployment. For Tyk Cloud users, you can get it from Tyk Cloud Console and retrieve the MDCB connection string.
      connectionString: ""
      # orgID of your dashboard user
      orgId: ""
      # API key of your dashboard user
      userApiKey: ""
      # needed in case you want to have multiple data-planes connected to the same redis instance
      groupID: ""
      # enable/disable ssl
      useSSL: true
      # Disables SSL certificate verification
      sslInsecureSkipVerify: true
```

```yaml
  # hybridPump configures Tyk Pump to forward Tyk metrics to a Tyk Control Plane.
  # Please add "hybrid" to .Values.pump.backend in order to enable Hybrid Pump.
  hybridPump: 
    # Specify the frequency of the aggregation in minutes or simply turn it on by setting it to true
    enableAggregateAnalytics: true
    # Hybrid pump RPC calls timeout in seconds. If not specified, default value will be picked up by Tyk Pump.
    callTimeout: 10
    # Hybrid pump connection pool size. If not specified, default value will be picked up by Tyk Pump.
    poolSize: 5
```

#### Uptime Pump
Uptime Pump can be configured by setting `pump.uptimePumpBackend` in values.yaml file. It supports following values
1. mongo: Used to set mongo pump for uptime analytics. Mongo Pump should be enabled.
2. postgres: Used to set postgres pump for uptime analytics. Postgres Pump should be enabled.
3. empty: Used to disable uptime analytics.

#### Other Pumps
To set up other backends for pump, refer to this [document](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-pump/blob/master/README.md#pumps--back-ends-supported)
and add the required environment variables in `pump.extraEnvs`
